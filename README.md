## Key Definitions

### Academic Integrity
> “Academic integrity in the academic environment means committing to six core values—even in the face of adversity: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage. These values guide behaviors that allow the academic community to translate ideals into action and ensure that awarded academic credentials accurately reflect students’ knowledge and capabilities.”

### Cheating
Any act of dishonesty or deception intended to gain or attempt to gain credit or improve performance assessment.  

### Plagiarism
Using another person’s work—such as words, images, ideas, logic, phrases, signature, or calculations—as your own without proper acknowledgment.  

### Self-Plagiarism
Reusing your own previously submitted work without authorization.  

### Contract Cheating
Commissioning another person to complete academic work and submitting it as your own for credit.  

### Fabrication
Falsifying or altering academic work, personal documents (medical, academic, or placement records), or creating/modifying inaccurate information to gain academic advantage.  

### Impersonation
Participating in exams or other assessments on behalf of someone else, with or without their consent, in any setting (physical or virtual).
